<h2 id="purpose">&#35; purpose</h2>
<pre>
a primary goal of envs.net is to be inclusive to the largest number of
contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. as such, we
are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all.
this code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in
our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.
we invite all those who participate in envs.net to help us create safe and
positive experiences for everyone.

This applies to conversation in the any room in the matrix community (<a href="https://matrix.to/#space:envs.net" target="_blank">#space:envs.net</a>),

any project in <a href="https://github.com/envs-net" target="_blank">github</a>/<a href="https://git.envs.net/envs" target="_blank">gitea</a> spaces and as well as for any <a href="https://help.envs.net/#user-account-features" target="_blank">services</a> on envs.

<h2 id="envs-mission">&#35; envs.net mission</h2>
<pre>
<strong>envs.net exists to foster an engaged community for socializing,
learning, and making cool stuff</strong>
in a mass-media age, it is up to small, intentional communities to gather and
work together to provide a space outside of the advertising-laden,
profit-seeking, corporate-owned world of social media.
to that end, envs.net strives to be a radically inclusive community where people
of all backgrounds and all technological experience levels can come together to
learn, to teach, and to delight in one another’s creations.
