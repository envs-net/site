	</div>

	<h2>chat language</h2>

	<p>since people from all parts of the world come together in our chat rooms, we write exclusively in <strong>english</strong>.</p>


	<h2>no flooding/spamming/trolling in main channels</h2>

	<p>multiline messages belong in a pastebin. feel free to use <a href="https://pb.envs.net" target="_blank">https://pb.envs.net</a> for a graphical pastebin.</p>

	<p>bot commands belong in #bots on tilde.chat. please limit yourself to 2 or 3 commands at a time.</p>

	<p>spamming commands is unacceptable and subject to the consequences below.</p>


	<h2>don't be lazy - read the documentation</h2>
	<p>if people tell you to read the documentation then you should do so.</p>

	<p>never say: <q>i'm too lazy. come on. you all know what i need to do. just tell me what i need to do.</q> this will get you ignored for all eternity.</p>

	<p>however you can expect to be told where to find the documentation. but if you get an url then get it and read it. if the documentation is too technical or you don't understand certain sections then say: <q>i have now read chapter 3.1 of the url you gave me and i understand how virtual domains work in general. but how would i use both virtual and non-virtual domains together?</q></p>


	<h2>unintended rudeness</h2>

	<p>sometimes you may feel that others are rude. you may get a response like <q>reinstall the package. restart the service. read the /usr/share/doc/mysoftware/readme.</q> although this is a very brief reply it is likely not meant to be rude.</p>

	<p>chats are often like human interaction without all the friendly bits. other people have probably answered your question a dozen of times today and they just want to help you solve the problem - not become close friends with you. don't be offended by it. the people don't mean it.</p>


	<h2>try to not repeat yourself</h2>

	<p>asking the same question every minute is annoying. if anyone in the channel isn't paying attention then they will neither read you the second and third time. and those who came back from lunch or sleep will likely see in their &quot;lastlog&quot; what has happened lately. this is too demanding.</p>

	<h2>avoid obnoxious behavior</h2>

	<p>envs is a purpose-driven community, intended to provide an environment where people can feel comfortable and supported in learning, practicing, or teaching about technology. while this purpose permits for a wide variety of activities on envs matrix channels, obnoxious or intentionally annoying behavior is not allowed.</p>

	<p>be considerate of the others on the IRC board; think about how they will perceive your chat messages. if people ask you to stop something, it's probably because you're being  obnoxious, and you should cut it out.</p>

	<p>examples of obnoxious behavior include posting your stream of consciousness ideas when you are not actually interacting with others, repeating variations of phrases over and over, intentional join/part spam, or interacting with bots to the point of crowding out interactions from others.</p>


	<h2>don't assume pronouns</h2>

	<p>if you know someone's pronouns, use them. try to default to they/them if you don't know.</p>

	<h2>last but not least</h2>

	<p>be considerate to your fellow tildizens and don't forget to have fun!</p>


	<h2>consequences</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>first offenses will be handled with a kick from the channel with an<br>
	explanation of the undesirable behavior. at this point, it's acceptable to rejoin.</li>
		<li>second offenses will be handled with a 1 hour tempban. following the<br>
	tempban, an chat admin will check in and let you know what kinds of behaviors to avoid.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>if the undesirable behavior continues, a permanent ban is applied.
	note that specific actions will also result in a permanent ban.</p>

	<p>if you have something that requires admin attention, please send an email to sudoers at envs dot net.</p>


	<h2>code of conduct & terms of service</h2>

	<p>please also note our <a href="/coc/">code of conduct</a> and <a href="/tos/">terms of service</a>.</p>
